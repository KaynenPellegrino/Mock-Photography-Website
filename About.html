			<div class="title"> Reasoning for Photography</div>
			<p> I want to use some incredible reason, that I wanted to help future photographers. Or I wanted to show them how to make their own website. Or even that I just wanted to show how awesome photography is. I won't lie, photography is awesome, but the truth is I don't care about any of that. I did this as a tribute to my hero. My uncle whom passed away in june of 2017. My uncle whom was a son, brother, father, uncle, motocross racer, and a photographer.</p>

			<div class="title"> How I did it</div>
			<p>I started by scouring the internet looking at every website I could involving photographers. I studied their source code, looked at W3, and used pluralnote. I also looked at a few of our fellow classmates designs for inspiration. I wanted it to be easy to maneuver, but look intricate and unique. I may have failed on that aspect though. But I feel I did succeed in simplicity and directness.</p>

			<div class="title">Where Can I do better?</div>
			<p>I think that the number one thing I could've done was make the website a bit more intricate. Prettier. I feel it's very bland, but with more practice I know I could do it. I also wanted to make it cascading pages, not multiple, so they scrolled and faded in and out of each page, if that makes sense. I also think adding some scripts to do some fancy things like a motorcycle revving as you entered the home page, or if I really wanted to overdo it, the page opens black and a motorcycle starts, showing that the black was the rear tire, and as it drives off, mud kicks onto the page and that becomes the background. It would match the actionshot on the main page pretty well.</p>
